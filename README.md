# Year Fact App

NB: due to the numbers-api-website I make the api request to not having HTTPS, the app does not work whilst hosted on GitHub. You can still view it by clicking on the link below.

A fun fact finding app. Enter any year, (be it negative or in the future) and get a fun fact.

Built using Fetch API.

Based on a free youtube excercise by Traversy Media. I changed the original app to fetch facts for years. I then further styled the app and added a Bootstrap toast as an extra exercise.
